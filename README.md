# Echo Space (Legacy)

This is the original version of **Echo Space**, built using **Node.js + Express** with static HTML pages.

This project represents my initial approach to building the app with a backend-first mindset, focusing on routing, file uploads, and basic SSR-like behavior using Express.

It is intentionally kept as-is and archived for reference.

## Tech Stack

- Node.js
- Express
- Static HTML/CSS/JS
- UploadThing (for file uploads)
- dotenv

No React. No SPA. No frontend frameworks.

---

## What This Version Does

- Serves static pages (`/`, `/login`, `/register`, `/upload`)
- Handles file uploads using UploadThing
- Uses Express routing
- Uses environment variables
- Acts as a simple backend + static frontend combo

---

## What This Version Does NOT Do

- No React
- No client-side routing
- No advanced SSR
- No frontend state management
- Not production-ready


---

## Project Status

**Archived / Frozen**

This codebase is not actively developed anymore.
It exists as a reference point and learning milestone.

A newer version of Echo Space will be built separately using a modern frontend approach.

## How to Run (if you really want to)

1. Install dependencies
2. Add a `.env` file

That’s it.
